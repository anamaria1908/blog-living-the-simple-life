                <h2 class="article-title">Embracing the Journey</h2>
                <p class="article-subheading">The pandemic brought unexpected challenges and changes to our lives, and for me, it led to a significant change in my career direction. As a Sales and Marketing Specialist, I often found myself frustrated with the limitations of unfortunate websites. It was during this time that I embarked on a journey of self-discovery, delving deeper into the world of web development and revealing a hidden passion for building pages from scratch.</p>

                <h3 class="article-subtitle">Overwhelm and Moments of Doubt</h3>
                <p class="article-paragraph">Navigating through online tutorials and resources, I soon found myself overwhelmed by the vastness of front-end development. I felt lost in a sea of information and questioned my ability to catch up with the abundance of beginners in the market, many of whom held degrees in the field. The weight of comparison and self-doubt led me to make the unfortunate decision to give up on my aspirations.</p>

                <h3 class="article-subtitle">A Reawakening and Resolution</h3>
                <p class="article-paragraph">Yet, after almost two years of abandoning my dreams, I had an awakening. The realization struck me with a profound clarity: front-end development was my true calling, something I genuinely loved. In the beginning of 2023, I made a firm resolution to start afresh, to disregard the doubts and I decided to embrace the power of resilience and determination.</p>
                <p class="article-paragraph">While my blog may be simple in its design and functionality, it holds a special place in my heart. It symbolizes the start of something meaningful â€” a platform for sharing my knowledge, insights, and experiences.</p>

                <h3 class="article-subtitle">Proud Steps Forward</h3>
                <p class="article-paragraph">Here we are, in the heart of July, and I couldn't be prouder of the progress I've made. Week after week, I witness my knowledge expanding, my skills evolving, and my passion growing stronger. I have come to understand that the best degree a human being can possess is the degree of motivation. It fuels us to overcome obstacles, push beyond boundaries, and continuously strive for personal and professional growth.</p>

                <h3 class="article-subtitle">One Step at a Time</h3>
                <p class="article-paragraph">Learning something new from scratch as an adult with numerous responsibilities is undoubtedly challenging, but it is far from impossible. I have learned that progress comes one step at a time, and the key lies in perseverance and patience. By embracing the journey and focusing on continuous improvement, I have come to realize that the only limits we face are the ones we impose upon ourselves.</p>
